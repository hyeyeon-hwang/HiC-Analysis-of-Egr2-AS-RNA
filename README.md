### Accessing .hic files
Converted GFP (control) .hic files are located in [converted_hic_data/gfp](converted_hic_data/gfp). <br>
Git Large File System (LFS) was used to upload the .hic files.

To successfully download the .hic files:
1. Install Git LFS on your system, if not already installed. <br>
  Git LFS setup instructions are available at: <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage#>
2. Clone repository. By default, this will download all Git LFS tracked files, i.e., all *.hic files in [converted_hic_data/gfp](converted_hic_data/gfp).
